# Heap-churn benchmark for the fragmentation/RSS work (RESEARCH §9 "Bench
# scenario"). It deliberately drives the two distinct retention mechanisms the
# research separates:
#
#   1. churn_graphs -- a high allocation rate of small, MIXED-SIZE object graphs
#      (instances, two list sizes, a map, a set, a tuple) with MIXED LIFETIMES:
#      a fixed-capacity ring keeps ~RING_CAP graphs live while every other graph
#      dies almost immediately. This is the textbook external-fragmentation
#      generator (§3.1) and the part an allocator swap is meant to help.
#
#   2. churn_strings -- produces many DISTINCT interned strings. The runtime
#      string table is immortal and unbounded (§3.3/§7.1), so this grows RSS in
#      a way NO allocator swap can fix; it is the control that proves the point.
#
# Run with SPUTNIK_HEAP_STATS=1 to get the RSS / live-bytes / fragmentation line.
# Counts are scaled for the reference interpreter (a few seconds); the string
# loop is kept modest because intern is an O(n) scan, i.e. O(n^2) overall.
#
# RING_CAP is deliberately large: the allocator-addressable symptom only appears
# when a big set of mixed-size objects is live SIMULTANEOUSLY and then dies,
# leaving the allocator holding pages. A small ring would free promptly and hide
# the difference. The ring fills, reaches a steady-state live heap, and is freed
# when churn_graphs returns -- so peak_rss captures the high-water and end rss
# captures how much each allocator hands back to the OS.
