# Polyglot benchmark

This benchmark compares identical workloads across:

- Sputnik interpreted: `build/isputnik --eval-file`
- Sputnik built native executable: `sputnik build <file.s>` first, then the
  generated host binary
- Python
- Ruby
- C++ compiled with `-O2`
- Go when `go` is available in `PATH`
- Rust compiled with `rustc -O` when `rustc` is available in `PATH`

The Rust implementations use only the standard library. Workloads that need
primitives Rust std does not ship (digests, base64/hex codecs, civil-calendar
time math) hand-roll them in the workload source, mirroring how the C++ rows
link the Sputnik runtime's own `runtime/digest.cpp` or carry their own helpers.
OS entropy for `secure-random` and `uuid` comes from a single `/dev/urandom`
handle opened once per process.

The Sputnik built path intentionally runs an already generated executable, so
compile time is not included in the measured run. The runner still builds fresh
`.sputnikbc` artifacts as a bytecode sanity check. For workloads that report
`sputnik-built`, that row is the native executable from `sputnik build`, not
`sputnikbc_run`.

Run (the defaults are five measured repeats, one unmeasured warmup, and a
deterministic balanced rotation of implementation order):

```sh
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --repeats 5 --warmups 1 --order-seed 0
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload calls-collections --repeats 5
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload sha-digest --repeats 3
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload json --repeats 3
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload codecs --repeats 3
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload secure-random --repeats 3
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload time-flow --repeats 3
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload uuid --repeats 3
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload string-ops --repeats 3
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload map-words --repeats 3
```

Each run writes a timestamped JSON provenance envelope and a Markdown report
to `bench/polyglot/results/`. The envelope contains every raw sample, measured
order, mean/median/standard deviation/CV/95% confidence interval, paired
throughput ratios, host and tool versions, Git commit and tracked-dirty state,
source-tree hash, and hashes of the exact executables. `SPUTNIK_BENCH_RUBY` can
pin Ruby explicitly; otherwise the newest discoverable RVM Ruby is preferred
over the system Ruby.

The HTTP RPS benchmark is a separate server-side comparison. It uses one
explicitly pinned Sputnik client from the sibling Ember checkout, built with
complete generated native-body coverage, with the soak workload's default four
clients against raw Sputnik `net.http`, Go, Rust, and Python servers. The runner
never rebuilds this client implicitly: use `--refresh-client-pin` once when the
client/runtime is intentionally changed, then reuse the reported path and
SHA-256 for every comparison. This is deliberately not called full native
execution: current
`net.http` calls use the reported `vm-stdlib-send-v1` runtime bridge even when
there is no bytecode-body fallback. Every server first has to
pass the full 76-request mixed contract iteration (CRUD plus the schema/model-
validation and protocol negative suite); each accepted row is then measured
for 60 seconds:

```sh
python3 bench/polyglot/run_http_rps.py --stack raw --duration 60 --clients 4 \
  --repeats 5 --order-seed 0 --languages sputnik --refresh-client-pin
python3 bench/polyglot/run_http_rps.py --stack raw --duration 60 --clients 4 \
  --repeats 5 --order-seed 0
```

The raw lane is deliberately framework-free in every language and is the VM /
HTTP-runtime optimization target. The complete Ember request pipeline remains
a separate lane:

```sh
python3 bench/polyglot/run_http_rps.py --stack ember --duration 60 --clients 4 \
  --repeats 5 --order-seed 0
```

This framework lane compares the complete Ember pipeline with Rails API 8 on
Puma. It rejects manual raw servers; conversely, the raw lane rejects Rails.
Both framework servers persist the catalog with ORM models over a shared
process-local SQLite `:memory:` database, so the timed table includes model
lifecycle, SQL generation, pooling, and SQLite execution without an external
database. They serialize SQLite-backed actions to keep lock-retry policy from
changing the common HTTP contract. Rails request whitelisting uses Rails 8
Strong Parameters (`expect` for replacement payloads and `permit` for PATCH),
with the same strict unknown-field contract as Ember. Set `SPUTNIK_BENCH_RUBY`
when Rails and Puma are installed under a Ruby that is not discoverable through
RVM or `PATH`.
The HTTP runner writes machine-readable JSON and a Markdown comparison table
to `bench/polyglot/results/`. Sputnik server builds require VM-independent full
native coverage; the Sputnik load-generator client remains a separately reported
native-body-covered HTTP-client bridge.

The micro runner prints median/mean wall-clock time, dispersion, and peak RSS
reported by a small Python measurement helper via
`resource.getrusage(RUSAGE_CHILDREN)`. It also
validates that every implementation returns the same checksum for the selected
workload:

- `arithmetic`: `715609516598740`
- `calls-collections`: `2047795430`
- `sha-digest`: `5512000`
- `json`: `1531352227`
- `codecs`: `2056190`
- `secure-random`: `296000`
- `time-flow`: `110397732`
- `uuid`: `1040000`
- `string-ops`: `280113`
- `map-words`: `235174`

The `json` workload exercises compact JSON generation, parse round-trips,
small pretty-generation round-trips, and streaming JSONL reads. The runner
prepares `bench/polyglot/build/json/events.jsonl` with 20,000 deterministic
records before measurement so peak RSS reflects streaming consumption instead
of input generation. The Sputnik built executable is compiled with
`--grant fs.read=bench/polyglot/build/json/events.jsonl` so its VM fallback can
profile the same file-I/O path under the capability-aware runtime world. The
runner requires full direct-native coverage for this workload; the generated
launcher still contains its ordinary bailout VM fallback, but the measured path
does not use it.

The `codecs` workload exercises `Bytes.new`, `Base64`, `Base64Url`, and `Hex`
encode/decode round-trips, including lenient base64/hex branches. The runner
requires full direct-native coverage for this workload as well.

The `sha-digest` workload now exercises the native `Digest` API rather than a
handwritten SHA-256 compression loop: CRC32, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and
HMAC-SHA-256 over four binary payloads. Streebog-256/512 and their Latin and
Cyrillic aliases are covered by RFC/vector tests and the full-native digest
fixture, but are excluded from the timed polyglot intersection because Ruby
and Go do not ship them in their standard libraries.

The `secure-random` workload exercises `SecureRandom.bytes`, `.hex`,
`.base64`, `.base64url`, `.uuid`, and `.int(range)` using real OS entropy.
The checksum validates lengths, codec round-trips, UUID shape, and integer
range membership rather than random contents. The Sputnik built executable is
compiled with `--grant random.secure`. The runner requires full direct-native
coverage for this workload, including `Range.new`, `SecureRandom.int(range)`,
and String shape checks.

The `time-flow` workload exercises `Time.parse`, `Time.utc`,
`Time.from_unix_ms`, `Time.from_unix_ns`, numeric `TimePeriod` literals,
calendar month arithmetic with end-of-month clamping, `TimePeriod + Time`,
`Time - Time`, field reads, ISO formatting, and comparisons. The runner
requires full direct-native coverage for this workload; the generated launcher
still embeds its ordinary bailout VM fallback, but `native_entry` is true and
every bytecode code object has direct native code.

The `uuid` workload exercises UUID v4 and v7 generation, canonical parse and
format round-trips, `inspect`, JSON formatting, version extraction, byte-value
equality, type matching, the `UUID` alias, and `SecureRandom.uuid`. It uses real
OS entropy and wall time, while its checksum depends only on UUID invariants.
The Sputnik executable is compiled with `--grant random.secure`, and the runner
requires every bytecode code object to have direct native coverage.

The `string-ops` workload (added 2026-07-02) exercises string building and
transformation: `+` concatenation, `upcase`/`downcase`, `split`, `replace`,
`trim`, `contains?`, `starts_with?`/`ends_with?`, and `length` over ~4000
generated record lines. Every language uses its standard string type and the
same algorithm; all strings are ASCII so codepoint- and byte-length semantics
agree. On Sputnik this additionally stresses the runtime string intern table
(every distinct runtime string becomes a permanent interned slot). The runner
requires full direct-native coverage for this workload.

The `map-words` workload (added 2026-07-02) exercises hash-map traffic: 30,000
insert-or-update rounds over 2,000 distinct string keys (a skewed quadratic key
stream), a full `each` iteration folding `value * key-length` (order
independent by construction, so hash-ordered languages agree), then 10,000
membership probes with a 2/3 hit rate. On Sputnik this measures the
name-indifferent `Map` (Symbol/Str canonicalization on every key operation).
The runner requires full direct-native coverage for this workload as well.

## Native value-lifetime rerun (2026-07-05)

Darwin arm64, same toolchains as the 2026-07-04 run. The Sputnik rows include
the native value-lifetime work from
`PLAN-native-value-lifetime-2026-07-05.md`: intrusive refcounts replace the
never-freeing `NativeArena` for data values, dynamic strings are refcounted
heap values instead of permanent intern-table slots (map keys still
canonicalize through interned ids; read probes use a no-insert lookup), the
generated code has a bool scalar lane beside the int/float lanes, hot payload
types recycle shells through per-type free lists, and `native_benchmark_send`
delegates `inspect`/`to_str` on non-Benchmark receivers instead of bailing
out (the Benchmark selector routing had silently pushed the whole uuid run
onto the VM re-run path, best 0.0547s, before this fix).

Fresh build pass into `/private/tmp/sputnik_polyglot_m4_20260705_01`, then the
stable rerun below, one workload per runner invocation:

```sh
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload <workload> --repeats 10 \
  --no-build --build-dir /private/tmp/sputnik_polyglot_m4_20260705_01
```

All rows validated their workload checksum; every workload reports full
direct-native coverage. Conformance corpus 173/0 and backend-equivalence
109/0 at this state.

Reading notes:

- Every sputnik-built row improved against the 2026-07-04 table; the largest
  moves are time-flow (0.0216 to 0.0064, now 2.6x the C++ best and 1.4x the
  Go best instead of 7.7x/4.4x), string-ops (0.0110 to 0.0053), codecs
  (0.0110 to 0.0068), and calls-collections (0.0078 to 0.0045). json keeps
  beating Go, uuid matches Go and beats Rust, and secure-random beats Rust
  (same `arc4random_buf` reason as before).
- The sputnik-built peak-RSS column is now flat at 1.4-2.1 MB — the same band
  as C++ and Rust — instead of scaling with workload allocation volume
  (previously up to 13.9 MB). Memory is proportional to the live set: a
  100x-iteration time-flow variant peaks at 4.1 MB where the pre-change
  binary peaked at 1.32 GB, and the ~38% of wall time that binary spent
  freeing the arena inside `exit()` is gone.
- Remaining gaps vs the C++ row are concentrated in the ~2 ms fixed process
  floor (an empty Sputnik executable runs ~2.7 ms vs ~2.1 ms for an empty C++
  binary under this measurement, and the zero-iteration workload floors are
  ~3.0-3.4 ms) plus per-value boxing on the time-flow/json hot paths. Net of
  each language's floor, sputnik-built compute is within ~2x of C++ on eight
  of ten workloads.

## Optimized full-suite rerun with Rust and the new workloads (2026-07-04)

Darwin arm64, `go version go1.26.4 darwin/arm64`, `rustc 1.96.0` (Homebrew),
system Python 3.9.6, Ruby 4.0.5 from RVM. Fresh build pass into
`/private/tmp/sputnik_polyglot_suite_optimized_20260704_01`, then stable reruns
below, one workload per runner invocation:

```sh
python3 bench/polyglot/run_benchmark.py --workload <workload> --repeats 10 \
  --no-build --build-dir /private/tmp/sputnik_polyglot_suite_optimized_20260704_01
```

All rows validated their workload checksum. Both new workloads (`string-ops`,
`map-words`) report full direct-native coverage. The Sputnik rows include the
2026-07-04 map/string hot-path optimizations documented in
`PLAN-polyglot-performance-optimizations-2026-07-04.md`. The arithmetic row was
refreshed after native int/float numeric fast-lane codegen, using a fresh build
in `/private/tmp/sputnik_polyglot_arithmetic_nativefast_20260704_01` and 10
repeats with Ruby 4.0.5 from RVM. The JSON row was refreshed after inline
small-map name indexes, native JSON integer parsing, and direct native JSON
object-entry construction, using a fresh build in
`/private/tmp/sputnik_polyglot_json_inlineidx_intparse_directobj_20260704_02` and
10 repeats with Ruby 4.0.5 from RVM.
The `time-flow` row was refreshed after generated native Time selector enums
and a native UTC field cache, using a fresh build in
`/private/tmp/sputnik_polyglot_timeflow_selector_enum_20260705_02` followed by a
warm `--no-build` 10-repeat timing run with Ruby 4.0.5 from RVM.

Reading notes:

- Rust sits on the C++ frontier as expected (each wins some workloads).
  Rust's `secure-random`/`uuid` rows are slower than C++ because the Rust
  implementation reads `/dev/urandom` through a file handle (one syscall per
  request) while C++ and the Sputnik runtime use `arc4random_buf`, a
  kernel-seeded userspace CSPRNG. Sputnik-built actually beats Rust on those two
  workloads for the same reason.
- `map-words` is no longer the outlier. The VM/runtime and generated-native
  map index work moves `sputnik-interpreted` from 0.9344s to 0.1027s and
  `sputnik-built` from 0.2920s to 0.0074s compared with the previous 2026-07-04
  table. The built row is now in the Go/Rust band for this workload, about
  2.2x the C++ best instead of about 88x.
- `string-ops` still shows the string-table lifecycle issue, but the hash-bucket
  intern index trims peak RSS (18.3 MB to 16.9 MB interpreted, 12.5 MB to
  11.6 MB built) and the VM string-construction quick paths improve the
  interpreted best from 0.0462s to 0.0337s.
- `json` no longer pays the eager-hash-index cost on every tiny object map.
  Small ordinary maps now keep an inline name index and promote to the unordered
  index only after eight entries, generated native JSON parses Int tokens
  without allocating a substring, and object parsing builds native map entries
  directly. The built row moved from 0.0154s / 10.8 MB to 0.0117s / 10.3 MB
  (confirmation runs ranged 0.0112-0.0117s best). `map-words` guard reruns
  stayed in band (0.0075s best, 2.6 MB RSS), so large-map lookup speed was
  preserved.
- Native numeric fast lanes moved `arithmetic` built from 0.0239s to 0.0064s,
  close to the C++/Rust 0.004s band. Cold-start cost is still visible in the raw
  samples (`sputnik-built` mean 0.0393s, first sample 0.3286s), so a structural
  no-fallback native launcher or split generated helper/runtime surface remains
  the next credible startup-size/startup-time optimization.

`sputnik-built*` may be produced by the benchmark script with an existing
compiler cache. Because the cache key is source-hash based, it can reuse stale
bytecode after compiler/emitter changes.

The hot `main` loop disassembles to zero generic `SEND` instructions for `+`,
`-`, `<`, and `>` where operands are integer. It contains 15 integer
arithmetic/comparison opcodes in the loop body and 19 in the method.

VM profiling after those bytecode fast paths showed that the remaining time was
not in the benchmark runner. A fresh `.sputnikbc` run and `isputnik --eval-file`
both settled around 0.38s. Instrumented counters for one fresh `sputnikbc_run`
execution showed:

Temporary probes isolated the next cost:

skip empty pattern erase   0.3475   avoids 12M empty unordered_map erases
direct integer registers   0.2710   avoids generic read/write/variant probes
```

The selected VM optimization keeps the same bytecode format and opcode mix. It
adds a plain-register path inside `IADD`/`ISUB`/`ILT`/`IGT` and `*K` when both
operands are already unboxed integer register payloads. Watched locals,
non-integer operands, uninitialized reads, out-of-range registers, and active
pattern state all fall back to the existing generic helpers. Generic `write_reg`
also skips pattern-state erases when all pattern maps are empty.

The next VM optimization keeps the serialized `.sputnikbc` format unchanged and
builds a VM-local quickened instruction array per `BcCode`. Fixed-arity hot
opcodes read decoded `a/b/c/imm` fields instead of
`std::vector<InstructionOperand>` on every dispatch. The VM also fuses
`ILT`/`IGT`/`ILTK`/`IGTK` followed by `JUMP_IF_FALSE` when a conservative CFG
walk proves the compare result register is dead and not present in
`local_layout`, preserving debug/completed locals.

The next VM optimization keeps the serialized `.sputnikbc` format unchanged and
adds a VM-frame integer sidecar (`int64_regs` plus validity bits). `LOADK`
integer constants and integer args seed the sidecar, `IADD`/`ISUB` write
unboxed integer results directly, and integer compare/fused-branch paths read
the sidecar first. Generic `Value` registers are materialized at boundaries
such as `read_reg`, `Return`, completed locals, watch storage, and GC root
collection; generic writes invalidate the sidecar.

The first measurement pass against that freshly built artifact had cold-process
outliers (`sputnik-interpreted` first sample `0.4596s`, `sputnik-built-fresh`
first sample `0.3544s`, and C++ first sample `0.1843s`). The table above is
the immediate stable rerun against the same fresh `.sputnikbc` artifact.
For compiler/emitter changes, continue to use a fresh `--out-dir` and
`--cache-dir`, or clear the generated benchmark cache deliberately. The cache
key is source-hash based and can reuse stale bytecode after compiler/emitter
changes.

The `calls-collections` workload adds helper-function calls and collection
traffic: nested list literals, `[]`, `first`, `count`, list arguments, and
helper loops over collections. Its Sputnik bytecode path runs module init through
`sputnikbc_run ... __init__`, because the compiled `main` closure captures helper
closures created by module initialization.

Latest local rerun after adding the captured-closure ABI and native list fast
path on 2026-06-04 (Darwin arm64, `go version go1.26.4 darwin/arm64`). The
runner prepares an `sputnik build <file.s>` native executable for each workload
and now rejects builds whose selected entry is not native or whose native code
count does not cover every bytecode code object. It passes `--entry main-only`
for the arithmetic workload and `--entry init` for `calls-collections`.

The measured tables below are stable `--no-build` reruns against fresh native
executables and language binaries built immediately before the rerun. All
measured checksums matched the expected checksum.

The arithmetic executable reports full native coverage for 2/2 code objects.
The `calls-collections` executable reports full native coverage for 10/10 code
objects: module-init closures use shared native capture cells, closure calls
stay in generated C++, and list literals plus `[]`, `count`, and `first` use
the direct list path. Its `sputnik-built` mean improved from the previous
`0.0101s` fallback result to `0.0032s`, about 3.2x faster and close to the Go
result. Stack-backed native register frames also improved arithmetic from the
previous `0.0051s` mean to `0.0042s`.

The `sha-digest` executable reports full native coverage for 9/9 code objects.
The workload exercises the SHA-256 compression schedule, list index assignment,
integer `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, and `>>`. The Sputnik source keeps the hot 32-bit
rotate/mix formulas inline so the native path does not pay closure-call ABI
cost for tiny bitwise helpers; 32-bit wrap uses `& 0xffffffff` instead of
division-based modulo.

## Numeric profile v1: checked Int arithmetic cost (2026-06-12)

sputnik.numeric-profile.v1 landed checked Int64 arithmetic as the default
profile (`__builtin_*_overflow` + policy resolution in every VM int path,
checked helpers + `NativeBailout` on overflow in the native lane). Same-day
same-machine A/B of the arithmetic workload, 10 repeats, against a clean
`HEAD` worktree without the numeric changes:

```text
lane                       baseline best   checked best   delta
sputnik-interpreted                 0.2984         0.3070    ~+3%
sputnik-built (native)              0.0046         0.0056   ~+0.001s (noise-level)
```

Absolute numbers are not comparable with the earlier tables in this journal
(different machine power/thermal state — the same-day baseline rerun of the
unchanged HEAD measured 0.2984s where the old table recorded 0.1409s). The
delta column is the meaningful result: overflow checking costs ~3% in the
interpreter, in line with the design expectation that interpreter dispatch
dominates. Non-default profiles (wrapping/saturating/narrow widths) run
VM-only; the native lane keeps default-profile semantics via bailout-restart.

## Phase 2 interpreter tuning (2026-06-12)

Same-day A/B against the pre-change HEAD build, best of 10 direct
`build/isputnik --eval-file` runs per workload (Darwin arm64). The serialized
`.sputnikbc` format is unchanged; all changes are VM-internal. Conformance
corpus (78), full `make test`, and `make backend-equivalence` (22) pass at
every step.

```text
workload            baseline   step1    step2    final    speedup
---------------------------------------------------------------------
arithmetic            0.3127   0.1621   0.1611   0.1549     2.0x
calls-collections     0.0145   0.0107   0.0110   0.0104     1.4x
sha-digest            0.1509   0.0880   0.0717   0.0715     2.1x
blocks micro (below)  3.50     —        —        0.54       6.5x
```

Step 1 — on-demand text source locations. `execute()` built a
`RuntimeTextSourceLocationScope` around every `step()`: a frame walk, a
source-span search, a file-string copy, and a TLS round trip per
instruction, only so text output events could be attributed to module
statements. Sampling profiles attributed ~25-35% of interpreter time to it
on both arithmetic and sha-digest. Output attribution now resolves through a
TLS provider installed once per `execute()` loop; text writers call
`resolve_runtime_text_source_location()` at output-event time and get the
same module-statement attribution.

Step 2 — quickened list `[]=` + allocation-free selector aliasing. Send
quickening previously stopped at one positional argument, so the sha-digest
inner loops (`w[i] = ...`) paid the full generic send path: operand vector
decode, args vector build, and ~24 selector string compares per store.
`SendSeqIndexSet` now handles two-argument `[]=` sends on lists with the
same fault classification as the generic handler (non-list receivers,
frozen lists, and non-integer indexes still fall back).
`canonical_collection_selector` returns references to static strings
instead of allocating per call.

Step 3 — block-call path. Builtin collection blocks (`each`/`map`/...)
constructed a fresh nested `Vm` per block invocation, which deep-copied the
entire `BcModule` (strings, symbols, const pool, all code objects),
re-quickened the block code, and threw both away after one element. Block
invocations now lease a pooled child Vm with append-only string/symbol
table sync at the lease boundaries in both directions. The sync also fixes
a correctness bug: strings interned inside a block escaped as
`<invalid-string>` because the nested module copy was dropped (pinned in
`corpus/run/block_string_intern_escape`). On top of that: per-frame pattern
state (`prepared_seq_regs`/`prepared_map_regs`/`pending_pattern_bindings`)
moved from `unordered_map` to flat vectors, so block-parameter prologues
stop paying hash-node malloc/free per invocation; block args pass as
`initializer_list` instead of heap vectors; per-opcode safepoints check
atomic mirrors of the remote-free queue depth and pending-GC flag before
touching the heap mutex; pooled block Vms skip the completed-frame register
snapshot that `finish_return` captures for `execute()` consumers.

The block microbench (not part of the polyglot suite; kept here for
reproducibility — 200k iterations x 8-element `each` = 1.6M block calls):

```sputnik
def main():
  data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
  total = 0
  i = 0
  while i < 200000:
    sum = 0
    data.each |x|:
      sum = sum + x
    total = total + sum
    i = i + 1
  total
```

Remaining known hot spots after this pass (sampled on sha-digest and the
block micro): interpreter dispatch in `step()`, the integer-sidecar
read/write helpers, and `Frame` move/destroy traffic in the call path. The
first two are the Phase 4 value-representation work; the frame moves need a
`finish_return` restructure that did not pay for its risk in this pass.

Step 4 — ivar sites (research plan §5.4), same-day follow-up. An
ivar-heavy micro (300k method calls, 8 ivar accesses each: a `Counter`
class whose `tick(i)` mutates `@a`/`@b`/`@total`) measured 0.397s best.
Profiling showed the cost was strings, not slots: every `LoadIvar`/
`StoreIvar` copied the ivar name out of the symbol table
(`optional<string>` per access), `StoreIvar` probed the inline cache and
then discarded the hit (`(void)cached_slot`) before re-resolving the slot
by name three times, and `try_apply_scalar_send` evaluated its
sequence/numeric selector-set memberships (~70 string compares)
unconditionally for every send — including plain user method calls.
`LoadIvar`/`StoreIvar` are now quickened with cache-hit fast paths
(pre-decoded operands, no name copy, store uses the cached slot and keeps
the legacy string-keyed `ivars` mirror in sync because GC tracing and
legacy lookups read it); watched objects, lifecycle faults, and cache
misses fall back to the generic handlers. The selector-set tests are gated
by receiver kind. Ivar micro: 0.397s -> 0.286s (-28%); the three polyglot
workloads and the block micro are unchanged (within noise). Remaining ivar
cost is the per-call method-send path (`call_caches` probe + generic
operand decode) and the global `ivar_caches` hash probe per access —
inline ICs in the quickened stream would be the next step but need
mutable per-site state, which the shared QuickCode does not have today.

## §5.8 emitter parameter int-speculation: attempted, reverted (2026-06-13)

Tried marking `param`/`block_param`/`implicit_block_param` slots as
speculative integer candidates in `analyze_integer_locals`
(`bytecode/emitter.cpp`), so parameter arithmetic emits `I*`/`I*K` opcodes
instead of generic `SEND`. The speculation is sound — every integer opcode
deopts to the full send path when an operand is not an `Int` at runtime, so
it only chooses opcodes, never semantics — and it required first fixing the
`I*K` constant-operand deopt to rebuild a full synthetic `Send` like the
register-operand deopt already does.

Same-day same-machine A/B, best of 8 after 2 warmups (Darwin arm64):

```text
workload            no-spec   with-spec   delta
---------------------------------------------------------
arithmetic           0.1529     0.1467     -4%   (noise band)

blocks (micro)       0.4993     0.4832     -3%
```

Reverted: a 3.7x regression on a shipped benchmark is not worth an 8% win on
an integer-parameter-leaf micro.

Root cause — `classify_direct_closure` (`runtime/vm.cpp`) holds hand-written
recognizers (`SequenceIndex`/`LaneIndex`/`WrapSubtract`/`MixLinearWrap`/
`ScoreRow`) that match the **exact `SEND`-shaped bytecode** of this
benchmark's leaf functions (`pick`/`lane_index`/`wrap`/`mix`/`score_row`)
and evaluate them inline with no frame push. Speculation rewrites those
`SEND`s to `IDIV`/`IMUL`/`ISUB`/`IGT`/`IADD(K)`, so 3 of the 5 recognizers
(`LaneIndex`, `WrapSubtract`, `MixLinearWrap`) stop matching and those
functions fall back to full frame pushes — the regression is call overhead,
not the integer ops. (`SequenceIndex`/`pick` and `ScoreRow` still match: `[]`
stays `SEND` and `score_row`'s arithmetic is on non-candidate locals.)

To unblock, in order:
1. Land the `I*K` constant-operand deopt fix (route through a full synthetic
   `Send` via a scratch register, matching the register-operand deopt). Today
   that path is unreachable — only proven-integer locals get `I*K` and their
   operands are always `Int` — so it cannot be landed or tested on its own;
   it must land with the speculation that makes it reachable.
2. Make the recognizers opcode-agnostic. A binary-op "view" that
   canonicalizes both a 1-arg binary `SEND` and the `I*`/`I*K` forms to
   `(selector, dst, lhs, rhs[, const])` lets `LaneIndex`/`WrapSubtract` match
   either shape unchanged (same instruction count, reg-reg ops). `MixLinearWrap`
   genuinely restructures (`LoadK`+`SEND` collapses to `IADDK`/`IMULK`, fewer
   instructions) and needs a second matcher.
   Better still: retire these benchmark-specific recognizers in favor of a
   general frameless-leaf-call path that consumes specialized bytecode.

## §6.1 heap allocator flag + fragmentation measurement (2026-06-13)

Layer-1 of `RESEARCH-heap-fragmentation-allocators-2026-06-12.md` §10 ("Now
(days)"): make the allocator swappable, instrument RSS vs. live bytes, add a
churn benchmark, and run the §9 measurement. Layers 2–3 (string-table
lifecycle, intrusive refcounts, slab pools, moving young gen) are unchanged and
remain the larger follow-on phases.

Landed:
- **`MALLOC=system|mimalloc|jemalloc` Makefile flag.** Sets the `SPUTNIK_ALLOCATOR`
  macro; for mimalloc/jemalloc it discovers the Homebrew prefix and, on macOS,
  `-Wl,-force_load`s the static archive so the malloc-zone override actually
  wins (plain `-l` does not interpose on Darwin). Default `system` build and
  flags are unchanged.
- **`RuntimeHeapStats.live_object_bytes` / `tracked_object_bytes`**, summed over
  `objects_` in `stats()` (allocation_size was already recorded per object).
  Shell bytes only — a cheap proxy, not a payload-exact live total.
- **`SPUTNIK_HEAP_STATS=1` dump** in the runner: one stderr line with allocator,
  current + peak RSS (mach `task_info` / `getrusage`), live/tracked bytes, and
  the RSS / live-bytes ratio. Off by default; never touches stdout.
- **`bench/heap/churn.s`**: a large (RING_CAP=40000) simultaneous live set of
  mixed-size graphs with mixed lifetimes, plus a distinct-interned-string loop.
  A small ring frees too promptly to show anything; the large ring builds a
  real fragmented heap then drops it.

Same-machine sweep, churn.s, Darwin arm64 (mimalloc 3.3.2, jemalloc 5.3.0):

```text
allocator   config                          peak RSS   end RSS   returned
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
system      macOS libmalloc                  ~97 MB     ~97 MB    ~0%
mimalloc    default / PURGE_DELAY=0          106 MB     106 MB    ~0%  (see note)
jemalloc    default                           95 MB      27 MB    ~72%
jemalloc    dirty/muzzy_decay_ms:0            95 MB    10.8 MB    ~89%  (≈baseline)
```

Output value `1411573421` is identical under all three — correctness preserved.

Findings:
1. **Peak RSS is allocator-independent (~95–106 MB).** It is set by the VM's
   4-malloc-per-object pattern over a large simultaneous live set; no allocator
   lowers it. Only §7 structural fixes (intrusive refcounts, slabs) cut peak.
2. **Page return is the allocator-sensitive symptom, and jemalloc wins on
   macOS**: 95 MB → 10.8 MB with aggressive decay. mimalloc's reclaim is real
   but uses `madvise(MADV_FREE)`, which marks pages reclaimable-under-pressure
   without dropping `resident_size` on Darwin — so its win is invisible to RSS
   here (it would show on Linux / via `vmmap` dirty-vs-clean). This is the doc's
   "macOS is second-tier, measure with vmmap" caveat (§4, §9) made concrete, and
   it nuances the "mimalloc default" pick: on macOS the *measurable* RSS win is
   jemalloc+decay; the mimalloc-vs-jemalloc default should be settled on Linux.
3. **Live heap is < 0.5 MB at a ~95 MB peak.** `live_object_bytes` ≈ 1.2 KB and
   jemalloc's at-exit `Allocated` is 474 KB; `gc_cycles=0` (refcounting freed
   all 2.4M objects promptly, GC never ran). RSS is overhead + page retention,
   not live data — exactly the doc's §3 thesis. The RSS/live-bytes ratio at
   end-of-run is therefore dominated by fixed baseline; **peak + post-churn end
   RSS across flavors, and jemalloc `stats_print`, are the informative numbers.**
4. **4-malloc/object spot-check (§9):** jemalloc cumulative `nrequests` =
   16,521,121 for the churn vs 642 for a trivial program ≈ 6.9 malloc calls per
   VM heap object. That is *above* the documented 4 (the remainder is per-iter
   interpreter temporaries + the string loop), consistent with — and a lower
   bound on — the 4-shell-allocations claim. Exact isolation needs a counter
   inside `allocate<T>`; deferred.

Net: the swap is worth keeping as a flag (jemalloc+decay is a real, free RSS win
on this workload), but it treats the symptom — peak is unchanged and the live
set is tiny, so the §7.1 string-table lifecycle and §7.2 intrusive-refcount work
remain the higher-impact levers. Run the sweep with `bench/heap/README.md`.

## §6.2 Layer-2a: O(1) string/symbol interning (2026-06-13)

First half of RESEARCH §7.1: the `intern_runtime_string` /
`intern_runtime_symbol` *time* blowup. Both did a linear scan of the whole
table per intern (`runtime/vm.cpp`), so string/symbol-heavy interpretation was
O(n²) — and `symbol_id_for_text` is also on the per-send selector-cache path
(`try_apply_scalar_send`), so every method send paid an O(symbols) scan.

Replaced the scans with incremental hash indices (`string_index_` /
`symbol_index_`, `text → id`) on `Vm`. The tables only ever grow (never
clear/shrink) and are occasionally appended to outside intern (nested-module
splicing, `vm.cpp:9669`/`9676`), so the index is folded lazily against a
watermark (`fold_string_index`/`fold_symbol_index`): a steady-state intern is a
single `find`; folding is O(new slots) and runs only after an external append.
`emplace` keeps the first id for a text, so ids and dedup semantics are byte-for-
byte unchanged (corpus + vm_tests green, churn value identical).

A/B on a distinct-string micro-bench (`bench/heap/intern_scaling.s`, 30 000
rounds ≈ 90 000 distinct strings), same machine:

```text
build                       time (30k rounds)
old (linear intern scan)        17.2 s
new (hash index)                 0.13 s     ~125× faster
```

This fixes the *quadratic time*; it does **not** bound table growth — the table
is still immortal (every distinct string is a permanent slot). Bounding the
*space* is Layer-2b, designed separately in
`DESIGN-string-table-lifecycle-2026-06-13.md` (it needs a Value-representation
change or GC-integrated string liveness, both larger and riskier than this).

## §6.3 Layer-2b Option D: make string-table growth observable (2026-06-13)

The space fix (DESIGN-string-table-lifecycle §4 Options A/B) is gated on the
§7.2 intrusive-refcount work and is not attempted yet. Its cheap, safe "now"
step (Option D) is landed: `SPUTNIK_HEAP_STATS` now also reports
`runtime_string_count` / `runtime_string_bytes` — the slots interned past the
module's compile-time string count, i.e. the unbounded region. Computed
runner-side from `ExecutionResult.runtime_strings` (`tools/sputnik/main.cpp`); no
VM API or `RuntimeHeapStats` change, stderr-only, off by default.

```text
workload                 runtime_string_count   runtime_string_bytes
intern_scaling (30k)            149 897                 1 267 804
churn.s                         39 369                   334 456
run_script fixture                    0                         0
```

Turns "the table leaks" into a number, closes RESEARCH §9's tracking for the
string table, and gives a before/after handle for the eventual Layer-2b fix.

## §7.2 intrusive refcount in ObjHeader (2026-06-13)

RESEARCH §7.2: every heap object paid a second malloc beyond its shell, because
`allocate<T>` wrapped it in `std::shared_ptr<T>(raw, deleter)` whose fat deleter
(captures `{shared_ptr<Impl>, worker, kind, allocation_id}`) forced a separate
~80 B control-block allocation. Moved the strong count into the `ObjHeader`
(which exists on every object already) and switched the six ObjHeader-bearing
kinds (Closure/Instance/List/Tuple/Set/Map) from `shared_ptr<T>` to an
`IntrusivePtr<T>`. Design notes in `DESIGN-intrusive-refcount-2026-06-13.md`.

- `IntrusivePtr<T>` is a single 8-byte pointer. All element-touching logic
  (`runtime_heap_add_ref`/`runtime_heap_release`) is out-of-line — declared in
  vm.h, defined + explicitly instantiated for the six kinds in vm.cpp — so it
  works with incomplete element types at the ~270 `.as_X()` consumer sites, just
  like `shared_ptr`. The count is atomic; drop-to-zero reuses `Impl::release`
  unchanged (same physical-free / cross-strand-queue path).
- The header keeps a type-erased `shared_ptr<void> heap` keepalive set in
  `allocate`. It both locates the heap on the drop path and guarantees the heap
  outlives its objects — the lifetime contract the old deleter's `shared_ptr<Impl>`
  capture provided. (First cut used a raw `Impl*` and crashed at teardown with
  `mutex lock failed` when an object outlived the heap; the keepalive, released
  in `runtime_heap_release` *outside* any Impl method, fixes it.)
- White-box tests that built objects via `make_shared` now use `make_intrusive`
  (unmanaged: `ref_count=1`, `heap=null`, plain-deleted on drop).

Malloc-count A/B (jemalloc cumulative `nrequests`, churn.s, 2,400,009 VM
objects, same machine):

```text
                       nrequests       per object
pre-§7.2 (shared_ptr)   16,521,121         6.88
post-§7.2 (intrusive)   14,201,092         5.92     -2,320,029  (~ -1 / object)
```

Exactly one fewer malloc per heap object — the control block is gone. ObjHeader
grows 24 B (atomic + keepalive) but a ~80 B per-object allocation disappears, so
each object is net smaller and costs one fewer malloc. `sizeof(Value)` is still
24 B: the variant still holds `shared_ptr` for ~18 non-ObjHeader types (BigInt,
error instances, the Runtime* objects), so the doc's 24→16 shrink needs that
tail converted too — deferred to a follow-up phase. Full `make test` green
(all unit suites + sputniktest 81/0).

### Value 24→16 tail conversion: investigated, deferred (2026-06-13)

Attempted next; backed out without committing. Converting the ~15 non-ObjHeader
`shared_ptr` tail alternatives to 8-byte intrusive pointers (the only way to drop
the variant's largest member to 8 B) hits a wall at `shared_ptr<RuntimeIoValue>`:
`RuntimeIoValue` is an abstract polymorphic base (5 derived kinds, ~77 shared_ptr
uses, 33 Value entry points) owned entirely by the io subsystem, which does not
even include vm.h. One unconverted alternative keeps `Value` at 24, so it is
all-or-nothing. Paths: box each alternative behind an 8-byte RcPtr<TailBox<T>>
(contained, but +1 alloc per tail value); full intrusive incl. an io-subsystem
rewrite (large/risky); or defer. Deferred by decision in favor of a smaller,
safer win; the RcPtr/RefCounted machinery was drafted and reverted.

## §7.5 pressure-driven remote-free drains (2026-06-13)

Cross-strand frees are deferred to the owning worker's `remote_frees` queue and
only physically reclaimed when that worker drains — which previously happened
only at four fixed interpreter points and at heap teardown, so an
actively-allocating strand's dead objects could pile up between drains. Added a
drain under the worker's own allocation pressure: `allocate` calls
`maybe_drain_on_pressure`, which every `kRemoteDrainAllocInterval` (256)
allocations drains the current worker's queue. `drain_remote_frees` already has a
lock-free `remote_free_pending_` early-out, so for single-strand workloads (no
cross-strand frees) this is a thread-local increment plus an atomic load every
256 allocations — churn.s time and value are unchanged (`remote_frees_queued=0`
there, so the path is a no-op). Correct-by-construction (it only drains more
often; nesting is safe — `RuntimeWorkerScope` is thread-local save/restore);
validated by the full suite including the cross-strand `stdlib_task_tests`. A
dedicated concurrent bench to quantify the queue-depth reduction is a follow-up.

## Phase 4: value-representation prototype A/B (2026-06-16)

PLAN Phase 4 ("value-representation prototype"): replace the 28-alternative
`std::variant` `Value` (24 B) with a compact tagged union (16 B), behind a
build flag, and A/B it against the variant baseline before committing to a full
migration. Both representations are now selectable with the `VALUE_REPR` Makefile
flag (`variant` default, `tagged` defines `-DSPUTNIK_VALUE_REPR_TAGGED`), mirroring
`MALLOC=`.

Design (tagged): a 1-byte `ValueTag` + an 8-byte union (`static_assert(sizeof ==
16)`). Immediates (null/bool/int/float/symbol-id/string-id/class-id/native-*)
and the six `ObjHeader` heap kinds (closure/instance/list/tuple/set/map, stored
as the inline header pointer) live in the union; the ~15 cold tail kinds
(BigInt/error/task/channel/io/...) are boxed behind a refcounted `ValueTailBox`
(one extra allocation + indirection per tail value, all cold paths). Copy/move/
destroy manage the intrusive `ObjHeader` refcount and the box refcount manually;
heap-kind release recovers the concrete type from `ObjHeader::kind` and reuses
the existing typed `runtime_heap_release` (all RuntimeHeap bookkeeping intact).
The `Value::` public API (factories, `is_X`/`as_X`) is byte-for-byte identical
across reps; only storage + method bodies differ. The three former
direct-variant call sites now go through `kind_index()` / `integer_if()`. The
native lane propagates the host sputnik's rep into the runtime-archive compile
flags (hashed into the archive cache key), so the native backend matches.

The int sidecar (`int64_regs`) is **kept** for this measurement, so the numbers
below are the pure representation delta (smaller copies + cheaper dispatch),
*not* the sidecar-removal win — under `tagged`, integers are inline so the
sidecar becomes redundant; removing it is the next lever (it touches many opcode
paths and is left as a follow-up).

A/B, best-of-8 direct `isputnik --eval-file`, interleaved reps, Darwin arm64:

```text
workload          variant     tagged     delta
----------------------------------------------
arithmetic         0.1515     0.1481     -2.3%
sha-digest         0.0719     0.0702     -2.3%
calls-collec       0.0109     0.0106     -2.3%
```

Heap churn (`bench/heap/churn.s`, system allocator, `SPUTNIK_HEAP_STATS=1`):

```text
metric              variant      tagged      delta
--------------------------------------------------
peak RSS            97.76 MB     88.88 MB    -9.1%
end RSS             92.98 MB     85.70 MB    -7.8%
live_object_bytes      1344         1288     smaller shells
allocations        2,400,013    2,400,013   identical
best time             1.827s       1.672s    -8.5%
```

Correctness (both reps): `sputniktest run corpus` 120/120, `backend-equivalence`
61/61 byte-identical, and the Value-heavy C++ suites (`vm_tests`,
`stdlib_collections_tests`, `stdlib_task_tests`) green. The tagged
`backend-equivalence` runs the VM lane *and* the native lane under the tagged
rep (both byte-identical), and the tail kinds are exercised by the task suite
(channel/mutex/atomic/barrier) and BigInt/error paths.

**Verdict — clear win, no regressions: proceed to the full migration.** A
uniform ~2.3% interpreter speedup *even with the sidecar still shielding the hot
integer path*, ~8.5% faster + ~9% lower peak RSS on collection-heavy churn, a
33% smaller `Value` (24→16 B, so every register file / list / tuple / map / ivar
vector is smaller and more cache-friendly), and zero correctness regressions
across corpus + backend-equivalence + unit suites. The gate in PLAN §1.6 is met.
Next levers (follow-ups), in order: (1) remove the now-redundant int sidecar
under `tagged` and re-measure arithmetic; (2) make `tagged` the default and
delete the variant branch once it has soaked; (3) the `heap_header_from_value`
fast path can become O(1) under `tagged` (return the inline `obj` pointer
instead of the `is_X` cascade).
