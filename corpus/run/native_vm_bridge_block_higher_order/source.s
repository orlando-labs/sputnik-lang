# Pins block support in the per-function VM bridge
# (sputnik.native-backend-equivalence.v1 step 2). `probe` is captureless and
# call-free; it builds block closures locally and passes them only to pure
# higher-order enumerables (map/select/reduce, plus `sorted` with a key block).
# Each block body is itself proven bridge-pure -- effect-free and capturing only
# enclosing locals (`factor`) -- so the whole function executes through the
# embedded-VM bridge rather than the whole-program native restart. The result
# is a scalar string, which converts back across the value bridge.
