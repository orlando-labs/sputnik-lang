# Pins the local-mutator + Set-algebra arm of the per-function VM bridge
# (sputnik.native-backend-equivalence.v1 step 2). `probe` is captureless,
# block-free, call-free and performs no IO, so it is vm-callable. It mutates
# only arrays it built itself (push!/insert!/sort!/reverse! -- vm.cpp RFC §8.1)
# and uses pure Set algebra (union/intersection/difference), then returns a
# string. In-place mutation is sound because the bridge can only reach
# locally-constructed heap values (scalar params, no captures/ivars/Call): the
# mutation is invisible to the native lane and discarded after the call, so the
# whole-program restart on any non-convertible bailout stays byte-identical.
