# amber.runtime.v1

Status: `W5.1` through `W8.3` runtime acceptance is satisfied, the `W8.4`
full conformance runner gate is satisfied through `ambertest`, `W9.2`
open-world transaction/freeze plus `W9.3` reflection mirror behavior is covered
in VM tests, `W9.4` package artifact tooling is covered by package tests, and
`W9.5` package hot-reload swaps, `W10.1` advanced concurrency runtime behavior,
`W10.2` awaitable/native-readiness behavior, `W10.4` frozen native trampoline
behavior, `W10.5` frozen image load barriers, and the `W13` runtime UNINIT,
`CALL`, and structured source-trace closure are covered by VM/native/image
tests.

The `net.http` Phase 7 basic server slice is also implemented in the runtime:
`net.http.Server`, `ServerRequest`, and `ServerResponse` are native stdlib
values backed by `runtime/vm.cpp` plus `runtime/stdlib_net_http.cpp`, with
focused loopback coverage in `build/vm_net_http_tests`.

The runtime error taxonomy is frozen in `spec/registries/runtime_errors.yaml`.

The first runtime implementation must keep frontend, bytecode container, VM, loader, scheduler, and memory boundaries separately testable. No stdlib helper may silently redefine language semantics that belong in parser, binder, HIR, or VM contracts.

Current implemented slice:

- standalone `runtime/vm.{h,cpp}` execution core for verified `BcCode`;
- frame-local register file and `last_result` slot;
- frame-local initialized-bit tracking for local and module-cell values, with
  runtime `NameError` on uninitialized reads and GC root scanning that ignores
  values not yet proven initialized;
- direct code entry with positional args;
- opcode subset: `LOADK`, `LOADNULL`, `LOADBOOL`, `MOVE`, `LOADSELF`,
  `GETLAST`, `SETLAST`, `MAKE_LIST`, `MAKE_TUPLE`, `MAKE_MAP`, `FREEZE`,
  `LOADUPVAL`, `STOREUPVAL`, `LOAD_IVAR`, `STORE_IVAR`, `LOOKUP_CONST`,
  `MAKECLOSURE`, `OBJ_DESTROY`, `OBJ_DEALLOC`, `CALL`, `SEND`, `SEND_DYN`,
  `JUMP`, `JUMP_IF_TRUE`, `JUMP_IF_FALSE`, `JUMP_IF_NULL`, `RETURN`, `RAISE`,
  `CLOSE_UPVALUES`, `SAFEPOINT`, plus the current pattern-op family;
- builtin scalar dispatch for integer arithmetic/comparison selectors and
  dynamic selector decoding from `Symbol` / `String`;
- runtime container values for list/tuple/map plus builtin `empty?`,
  collection indexing, `deconstruct` / `deconstruct_keys` bridging for matcher
  paths, and W8.3 eager collection SEND selectors for sequences and maps;
- local class-object lookup for single- and multi-segment `KONS[path]`
  constants, with exact full-path matching before unique leaf fallback;
- class/instance method dispatch through `CLAS.method_range_*`, direct
  superclass lookup, instance-side `include` linearization, and class-side
  `extend` linearization for single- and multi-segment local refs;
- monomorphic runtime inline caches for `SEND` / `SEND_DYN` method hits and
  `LOAD_IVAR` / `STORE_IVAR` slot lookup, guarded by receiver class,
  selector/name, dispatch method version, `world_epoch`, and ivar
  `shape_id` / `shape_version` where applicable;
- persistent `RuntimeWorld` execution context with atomic
  `RuntimeWorldTransaction` commits for class/mixin reopen, instance/class
  method replacement, direct `include`, and class-side `extend`, with
  pre-commit kind/superclass/include-cycle validation, rollback on failure,
  `open -> frozen` state, `WorldFrozenError` guards, and observable
  `world_epoch` / owner `method_version` invalidation;
- open-world dev-profile package hot reload in `RuntimeWorld`, using
  `reload_package_artifact` to predecode a whole `.amberpkg` module set,
  reject frozen worlds, enforce manifest identity plus ABI/profile/export
  surface and selector/arity compatibility, publish the root module atomically,
  and invalidate dispatch through a single `world_epoch` bump;
- runtime reflection mirror snapshots for package/world/class/mixin/method
  state through `RuntimeWorld::{package,world,class,mixin,owner}_mirror`,
  returning copied read-only views with deterministic method/export/dependency
  ordering, direct include/extend visibility for static and late dynamic edges,
  source locations from bytecode debug spans, and no mutable method-table
  backdoor;
- `method_missing` fallback on class/instance dispatch without recursive
  fallback on the `method_missing` selector itself;
- shared `CallPacket` decoding for `CALL`, covering closure invocation,
  constructor calls on class objects, and ordinary objects exposing an
  instance-side `call` method;
- constructor `CALL` on class objects, allocating an instance and routing to
  instance-side `init` when present;
- tail positional default-thunk materialization for method dispatch and
  constructor `init` dispatch;
- runtime keyword shaping for positional/keyword method dispatch, with
  monomorphic call-cache keys guarded by selector, positional count, canonical
  keyword symbol shape, block presence, receiver class, world epoch, and method
  version, plus runtime cache stats for focused dispatch-cache regression
  coverage;
- forwarded block values for user-defined `SEND` / `SEND_DYN` / constructor
  `init` dispatch;
- eager runtime execution of `BcMethod.clause_table[]` through emitted clause
  pattern-probe code plus nested guard/body execution, with transactional
  pattern-local commit on successful clause match;
- inline matcher execution for `case` / `case!`, block-pattern prologues, and
  pattern assignment across scalar/class/sequence/map paths:
  `PPrepSeq`, `PPrepMap`, `PCheckEq`, `PCheckPin`, `PCheckLenEq`,
  `PCheckLenGte`, `PGetIndex`, `PHasKey`, `PGetKey`, `PTripleEq`, `PBind`,
  `PCommit`, `PFail`;
- deferred pattern-binding semantics for `PBind` / `PCommit`, including
  rest-slice materialization for sequence/map rest bindings and strict-map
  extra-key rejection on success boundary;
- public `ObjHeader` / `ShapeDescriptor` metadata on heap values, with
  slot-backed `InstanceValue` ivar storage and a legacy map mirror for tests and
  slow-path compatibility;
- stable shape interning for root class shapes and ivar growth transitions,
  guarded by `shape_id` / `shape_version` in ivar inline caches;
- dead-shape compatibility checks for instance ivar access before ordinary
  shape-cache lookup, returning `UseAfterFreeError` for tombstone-like headers;
- runtime owner method-table descriptors populated from `CLAS.method_range_*`
  and dynamic method replacement, with class/instance table observability through
  `RuntimeWorld::method_table_size(...)`;
- per-execution class storage semantics for `LOAD_CVAR` / `STORE_CVAR`;
- runtime-side ivar auto-assign commit for `@field` params before method body
  execution, plus class-variable auto-assign for `@@field`;
- `W6.1` heap allocation boundary for runtime-owned instances, lists, tuples,
  maps, and closures, with allocation ids in `ObjHeader`, per-worker arena
  counters, remote-free queues, owner-side drain semantics, and safepoint/final
  execution drain hooks;
- `W6.2` lifecycle baseline with `ObjectLifetimeState`, special `destroy!`
  dispatch, `OBJ_DESTROY` / `OBJ_DEALLOC`, idempotent destroy/dealloc results,
  tombstone `DeadShape` rewrite, payload release for instances, lists, tuples,
  maps, and closures, ownership/lifetime precondition errors, and
  `DestroyedAccessError` /
  `UseAfterFreeError` guards for ordinary access paths;
- `W6.3` non-moving GC boundary with `ObjectGeneration`, public
  `RuntimeGcCycle` collection hooks, logical mark/sweep over heap allocation
  records, root scanning for VM frames and runtime class cvars, write barriers
  for heap-reference writes, mature-to-young remembered sets, shared-to-confined
  isolation rejection, safepoint-triggered collection requests, unrooted cycle
  logical reclaim, caller/back-edge safepoint root preservation, rooted
  local/shared cycle preservation, and parallel smoke coverage;
- `W6.4` pinning/native boundary with public `RuntimePinToken`,
  active-pin registry roots for GC, `RuntimePinScope` nesting, stale/double
  unpin guards, `PinnedObjectError` lifecycle rejection, opaque managed handles,
  pinned list/tuple value-buffer views, native wait cancellation poll hooks, and
  exception-unwind pin-scope release;
- `W7.1` worker-pool scheduler with public `RuntimeScheduler`,
  `RuntimeWorkerScope` / `RuntimeStrandScope` TLS, global and worker-local
  runnable queues, timer-backed sleeping strands, explicit wake coalescing,
  deterministic idle waits, and parallel smoke coverage;
- `W7.2` task lifecycle with task TLS, join/rethrow results, timed joins
  without auto-cancel, cooperative cancellation polling, structured child sets,
  waiting parent scope exit, first-failure propagation, and sibling
  cancellation;
- `W7.3` concurrency primitives with `RuntimeChannel` rendezvous and buffered
  modes, FIFO blocking send/recv queues, explicit `close()`,
  `ChannelClosedError`, timeout/cancellation-aware blocking results,
  recursive shareability checks for channel payloads, non-reentrant
  `RuntimeMutex`, and seq-cst `RuntimeAtomic`;
- `W10.1` advanced concurrency runtime in `runtime/vm.{h,cpp}` with
  `RuntimeMoveSlot` ownership-transfer reservations, moved-from
  `MovedValueError` reads, move-aware `RuntimeChannel::send` for confined heap
  graphs, receiver-side adoption of moved payloads, `runtime_select` recv/send
  arms with timeout and immediate `else` behavior, rotating ready-arm selection
  to avoid fixed left bias, and structured-task supervisor policies
  `CancelScope`, `OneForOne`, `OneForAll`, and `RestForOne` through
  `RuntimeTaskOptions`;
- `W10.2` async-I/O awaitable bridge in `runtime/vm.{h,cpp}` with
  `RuntimeAwaitable` pending/ready/failed/cancelled states, awaitable-compatible
  `runtime_select` arms, bounded await/poll behavior, cooperative task
  cancellation propagation, and native wait readiness tokens backed by active
  W6.4 pin handles;
- `net.http` Phase 7 basic server in `runtime/vm.{h,cpp}` and
  `runtime/stdlib_net_http.cpp`, exposing `Server`, `ServerRequest`, and
  `ServerResponse` native stdlib values; `Server(...)` performs a `net.listen`
  capability check and binds a `net.tcp` listener, `Server#serve(max_requests:)`
  accepts a request block, request parsing supports bounded plaintext HTTP/1.1
  headers and fixed `Content-Length` bodies, handler results may be
  `ServerResponse`, `Str`, `Bytes`, or `null`, and the first server
  implementation writes `Connection: close` after one request per accepted
  connection;
- `W10.4` native/JIT runtime bridge in `runtime/native_bridge.{h,cpp}` with
  `amber.native.v1` world-epoch and method-version assumption checks,
  frozen-world rejection, deterministic bytecode-trampoline execution through
  `RuntimeWorld::execute`, and explicit bytecode fallback for stale native
  assumptions when the caller discards invalid native code;
- `W10.5` frozen image runtime loader in `runtime/frozen_image.{h,cpp}` with
  verified `.amberimg` package load, immediate `RuntimeWorld::freeze_world()`,
  native metadata binding to the frozen world mirror when in-memory metadata is
  available, and package hot-reload rejection through the existing
  `WorldFrozenError` barrier;
- `W8.1`-`W8.2` loader baseline in `runtime/module_loader.{h,cpp}` with
  serialized `.amberbc` decode/verify on every load path, dependency graph
  linking, deterministic dependency-before-dependent module init, single-run
  init snapshots, missing-dependency/export `ImportError`, dependency
  format/language/ABI compatibility diagnostics, export-cell/import-alias
  snapshots, read-only alias readiness checks, re-export chain resolution,
  cycle-aware `ModuleInitError`, and source-mapped VM fault propagation for
  failed module init;
- `W8.3` collections baseline in `runtime/vm.{h,cpp}` with closure-block
  execution for eager sequence `each`, `map`, `filter_map`, `flat_map`,
  `select`, `reject`, `reduce`, `find`, `any?`, `all?`, `none?`, `first`,
  `count`, `group_by`,
  `to_a`, membership checks, set-like operations, subset/superset/disjoint
  predicates, collection operator methods, `each(size, step:)`,
  `each_pair`, `each_cons`, `take_while`, `reverse`, `sort`, `uniq`,
  `permutation`, `combination`, eager-compatible `lazy`, and mutating
  `Array` / `Set` `filter_map!`, plus `Map#each`, `Map#each_pair`,
  `Map#map`, `Map#filter_map`, `Map#select`, `Map#reject`, `Map#transform`,
  `transform_values`, `merge`, `contains?`, `include?`, `+` / `|` merge
  aliases, `keys`, `values`, and `entries` with insertion-order-preserving
  results and canonical `IndexError` / `KeyError` edge behavior;
- `STD-010` task module runtime-facing surface in `runtime/vm.{h,cpp}` with
  `RuntimeTaskModule::{async,spawn,sync,sleep,yield_current}` and
  `RuntimeTaskHandle` task/strand ids, `wait(timeout)`, non-blocking `result`,
  `failure`, cancellation, resume, and state predicates backed by the existing
  W7 scheduler; `sync` installs a sync-depth guard for future `sync:` /
  `task.sync:` lowering and suppresses cooperative yielding inside that block;
- `STD-011` `RuntimeTaskHandle` state/result/failure contract with
  `RuntimeTaskHandleState`, `RuntimeTaskHandleSnapshot`, `state()`,
  `snapshot()`, state-bearing `wait` / `result` / `failure` responses, and
  canonical task error names for inactive, unfinished, timed-out, failed, and
  cancelled handles;
- `STD-012` Channel API and FIFO corpus with `RuntimeChannel` construction,
  `send`, move-aware `send`, `recv`, `close`, `closed`, and `stats`; checked
  payload shareability rejection, `ChannelClosedError` close edges,
  buffered/rendezvous FIFO, waiting sender/receiver FIFO, timeout, and receive
  cancellation behavior are covered by `stdlib_task_tests`;
- `STD-013` Mutex API and synchronize guard with `RuntimeMutex` construction,
  `lock`, `unlock`, `locked`, `owned`, `synchronize`, and `stats`;
  non-reentrant `DeadlockError`, non-owner/unlocked `OwnershipError`, waiter
  FIFO acquisition, block return propagation, exception-unwind unlock, and lock
  cancellation behavior are covered by `stdlib_task_tests`;
- `STD-014` Atomic API with `RuntimeAtomic` integer compatibility facade plus
  value-level `get_value`, `set_value`, `compare_and_set_value`, and `update`;
  atomic payload writes reject incompatible confined values with
  `AtomicCompatibilityError`, heap CAS compares by identity, update uses a
  seq-cst CAS loop that may re-run its block, and cross-strand counter behavior
  is covered by `stdlib_task_tests`;
- `STD-015` inter-thread flow surface with `RuntimeBarrier` reusable generation
  barriers and `RuntimeFlowModule::{gather,scatter,scatter_map,scatter_reduce,
  broadcast}`; flow workers reuse `RuntimeTaskHandle`, preserve ordered gather
  by default, validate checked-mode partitions/results with `IsolationError`,
  expose collect/ignore/first failure policies, and cover barrier release,
  timeout/cancellation, ordered gather, map, reduce, broadcast, failure
  collection, and checked/unchecked isolation in `stdlib_task_tests`;
- `STD-016` auto-parallel collection facade with `RuntimeThreadedCollection`
  over `RuntimeFlowModule`, covering ordered `each`, `map`, `select`, `reject`,
  `filter_map`, `flat_map`, `combination(count)`, and `permutation(count)` for
  `[...].threaded(workers)` lowering in the VM and full native builds; the native
  adapter in `runtime/threaded_native.inc` invokes C++ closures directly and
  preserves shared capture cells with synchronized reads and writes (compound
  updates still require `Atomic` or `Mutex`); checked mode validates inputs and worker
  results with `IsolationError`, unchecked mode delegates responsibility to the
  caller, `each` discards block results and returns the original items in input
  order by default, matching sequential `each`; flow failure policies are
  preserved, and `stdlib_task_tests` covers
  ordered transforms, generated rows, failure collection, isolation edges, and
  cancellation cleanup; `tests/threaded_backend_test.py` checks VM/native parity
  and strict native coverage, including the 10,000-process/500-worker workload;
- `W8.4` conformance gate in `tools/ambertest` with deterministic fixture
  discovery, focused mismatch rendering, phase aliases for
  `lower`/`compile`/`disasm`, positive `check`/`run`/`load` lanes, and
  cumulative `M1`-`M5` bundle filtering exposed through `make conformance`;
- `W9.4` package tooling in `package/package.{h,cpp}` and `amberc package-*`
  commands with restricted manifest parsing, deterministic lock rendering,
  reproducible `.amberpkg` serialization, SHA-256 dev signatures, artifact
  verification, and filesystem registry install/publish smoke;
- `W9.5` package hot-reload runtime path in `runtime/vm.{h,cpp}` with
  compatible body-swap success, incompatible export/arity rejection,
  frozen-world rejection, and failed-decode rollback coverage;
- direct `P_PREP_SEQ` / `P_PREP_MAP` coercion through object-level
  `deconstruct` / `deconstruct_keys(keys)` when native list/tuple/map
  matching is not available, with `null` as no-match and wrong protocol return
  types as `TypeError`;
- `RAISE` execution with handler-table protected-range lookup, unwinding across
  active method and closure frames, out-of-line rescue handler code execution,
  and unhandled fault traces backed by structured `SPAN` / `LINE` metadata,
  including module id, byte start/end, line/column start/end, and generated-span
  kind where present;
- unit coverage for emitted methods, branching/falsey semantics, and closure
  capture/call baseline, plus emitted and dynamic send scenarios, class-side
  lookup/send, constructor call, keyword shaping, block forwarding, instance
  dispatch, unicode auto-assign, ivar/cvar load/store, multi-segment class
  refs, cache guard miss paths, keyword order canonicalization, block-presence
  cache separation, keyword-call world-epoch invalidation, dynamic method
  replacement invalidation, late include invalidation, object `deconstruct*`
  pattern protocol paths, and
  handled/unhandled `RAISE` paths, plus W5.4 slot-shape transition stability,
  dead-shape guard, method-table descriptor coverage, W6.1 allocator stress /
  remote-free / VM allocation-path coverage, W6.2 lifecycle destroy, dealloc,
  tombstone, and dead-access coverage, W6.3 non-moving GC, barrier,
  remembered-set, safepoint-root, caller/back-edge root, rooted cycle, and
  parallel smoke coverage, and W6.4 pin roots, stale-unpin, nested-scope,
  exception-unwind release, opaque-handle, buffer-view, dealloc-after-pin,
  native-wait-cancel, and parallel pin/unpin coverage, plus
  W7.1 worker-pool scheduler, strand TLS scope, timer wake, explicit wake
  coalescing, and parallel strand smoke coverage, and W7.2 task lifecycle,
  join/rethrow, timed join, cooperative cancellation, waiting scope-exit parent,
  structured child, and first-failure sibling-cancellation coverage, plus W7.3
  rendezvous/buffered channel close/FIFO/isolation coverage, mutex
  reentrancy/contention coverage, and atomic compare-and-set contention
  coverage, plus W8.1-W8.2 verifier-gated module load, missing dependency,
  dependency init order, single-run init, cycle detection, failed-init, export
  alias, missing export, version/ABI mismatch, re-export, source-mapped
  loader diagnostic coverage, post-W15 live alias export-cell transitions, and
  sticky failed-init/cyclic-init retry coverage, plus W8.3 eager sequence
  chaining, `reduce`
  empty-error, indexed-access `IndexError`, map lookup `KeyError`, `flat_map`,
  `count`, `find`, `group_by`, ordered `Map` projection/transform coverage,
  and W9.2 open-world transaction coverage for
  rollback, `WorldFrozenError`, `SuperclassMismatchError`, include-cycle
  rejection, mixin method replacement, and late class-side `extend`
  invalidation, plus W9.3 mirror coverage for read-only snapshots,
  deterministic ordering, source locations, and post-mutation stability, plus
  W9.4 package manifest/lock determinism, signed artifact reproducibility,
  signature rejection, and registry publish/install smoke coverage, plus W9.5
  package hot-reload coverage for compatible swaps, incompatible export/arity
  guards, frozen-world rejection, and failed-decode rollback, plus W10.1
  runtime coverage for moved channel payloads and moved-from reads,
  `select` fairness/else/timeout paths, moved send-arm commit behavior, and
  supervisor `one_for_one`, `one_for_all`, and `rest_for_one` propagation, plus
  W10.2 awaitable coverage for select readiness/timeout/failure, scheduler wake
  after native wait completion, stale-pin failure, and cancellation finishing
  native waits, plus W10.4 native metadata/trampoline coverage for root maps,
  allocation/call/back-edge safepoints, native trampoline argument roots,
  reflective `SEND_DYN` stubs, frozen-world execution, and stale-assumption
  bytecode fallback, plus W10.5 frozen image coverage for reproducible
  `.amberimg` build/verify, frozen runtime load, bound native execution, and
  reload-barrier rejection, plus W13 runtime coverage for uninitialized
  register reads, object `call` protocol dispatch through `CALL`, and structured
  source-span trace fields.

Still intentionally missing in later layers:

- stdlib/language surfacing for W10.1-W10.2 advanced runtime primitives outside
  the closed task/sync/flow/threaded stdlib slice.
