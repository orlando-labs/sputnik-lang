---

# 0. Integration note

This patch changes Sputnik `Map` and `Set` from symbol-only / identity-adjacent key behavior into ordered, value-keyed collections.

The runtime remains ordered-vector based in this patch. No hash table is introduced.

The core change is:

```sputnik
m = {1: "int", "name": "str", :name: "sym"}

m[1]        # "int"
m["name"]  # "str"
m[:name]   # "sym"
```

and:

```sputnik
s = {[1, 2], (1, 2)}
s.count()  # 1
```

`Map` keys and `Set` elements are normalized and compared through a deterministic runtime key equality helper. Duplicate `Map` keys overwrite the stored value. Duplicate `Set` elements collapse.

Existing symbol-key maps remain compatible:

```sputnik
{name: value}
```

continues to mean:

```sputnik
{:name: value}
```

For an expression key named by a variable or arbitrary expression, use parentheses:

```sputnik
{(name): value}
{(user.id): value}
{(compute_key()): value}
```

Pattern matching and `deconstruct_keys` remain symbol-key based. Non-symbol keys are preserved in maps but are not matched by named-key map patterns.

---

# 1. Design principles

## 1.1. `Map` and `Set` are ordered value collections

`Map` and `Set` preserve insertion order. This patch changes only key/element comparison semantics.

Implementation remains conceptually:

```text
MapEntry[] entries
```

not:

```text
HashTable buckets
```

Key lookup is linear in the number of entries in the reference implementation profile.

Future implementations may add hash acceleration only if observable key equality, insertion order, overwrite behavior and diagnostics remain identical.

---

## 1.2. Value-key equality is explicit runtime behavior

`Map` and `Set` use a dedicated runtime key equality helper, not generic object identity and not host-language pointer equality.

The helper is frame-aware because user-defined object equality may execute Sputnik code:

```text
map_key_equal(vm, frame, stored_key, lookup_key) -> Bool | Error
```

For built-in scalar and structural keys, the helper uses Sputnik value semantics.

For instance objects, it uses the stored key's `==` method, subject to strict validation rules.

---

## 1.3. User objects need meaningful value equality

Instance objects are accepted as `Map` keys and `Set` elements only when equality lookup resolves to a user-defined, non-default value equality implementation.

A default identity fallback such as `Object#==`, if present, is not sufficient.

Inherited user-defined equality is sufficient:

```sputnik
class A:
  def ==(other):
    other.is_a?(A)

class B < A:
  noop

{B(): 1}  # valid, because meaningful equality is inherited
```

Objects without meaningful value equality are rejected when used as keys or set elements.

Required error:

```text
TypeError
object used as Map key must define value equality with `==`
```

For `Set`:

```text
TypeError
object used as Set element must define value equality with `==`
```

---

## 1.4. Equality is stored-key dispatched

For object keys, lookup compares:

```sputnik
stored_key == lookup_key
```

not:

```sputnik
lookup_key == stored_key
```

and not a symmetric combination of both.

This rule is intentional.

It makes ordered-vector lookup deterministic and makes duplicate insertion depend on existing stored keys in insertion order.

Example:

```sputnik
class A:
  def ==(other):
    true

class B:
  def ==(other):
    false

a = A()
b = B()

m = {a: :stored_a}
m[b]       # :stored_a, because a == b

m2 = {b: :stored_b}
m2[a]      # KeyError, because b == a is false
```

---

## 1.5. Duplicate overwrite preserves the first stored key

When a duplicate key is inserted into a `Map`, only the value is updated. The stored normalized key is not replaced.

```sputnik
m = {1: "int", 1.0: "float"}

m[1]       # "float"
m[1.0]     # "float"
m.keys()   # [1]
```

Rationale:

* insertion order remains stable;
* the first spelling/representation remains visible through `keys`, `entries`, `each` and `to_a`;
* duplicate insertion has minimal mutation surface.

For `Set`, duplicate insertion keeps the first stored normalized element.

---

## 1.6. Composite keys are normalized snapshots

Array/list keys are normalized to immutable tuple snapshots before storage and lookup.

Nested arrays/lists inside tuple/list keys are normalized recursively.

```sputnik
xs = [1, 2]
m = {xs: :ok}

xs[0] = 9

m[(1, 2)]  # :ok
m[(9, 2)]  # KeyError
```

This normalization is equivalent to the built-in Array-to-Tuple conversion for built-in arrays, but it is a runtime-internal key normalization operation. It must not dynamically dispatch to user-defined conversion hooks.

---

## 1.7. Cyclic composite keys are rejected

Cyclic Array/Tuple structures are not supported as keys in this patch.

Invalid:

```sputnik
a = []
a.push(a)

{a: 1}
```

Required error:

```text
TypeError
cyclic composite Map keys are not supported
```

For `Set`:

```text
TypeError
cyclic composite Set elements are not supported
```

Rationale:

* cycle-aware structural equality is significantly more complex than ordinary tuple equality;
* rejecting cycles is deterministic and easy to diagnose;
* this patch does not introduce graph isomorphism semantics for collection keys.

---

# 2. Runtime representation

## 2.1. `MapEntry`

Runtime `MapEntry` changes from:

```text
MapEntry(symbol_id, value)
```

to:

```text
MapEntry(key: Value, value: Value)
```

The stored `key` is always a normalized key value.

Compatibility helper remains:

```text
make_symbol_map_value(...)
```

It builds a `Map` whose keys are `Symbol` values.

New canonical helper:

```text
make_map_value(entries: [(Value key, Value value)])
```

This helper normalizes and validates keys and applies duplicate-overwrite semantics.

---

## 2.2. Required key helper boundary

The runtime should expose or internally centralize the following helper boundaries:

```text
map_key_normalize(vm, frame, value) -> Value | Error
map_key_validate(vm, frame, normalized_key) -> void | Error
map_key_equal(vm, frame, stored_key, lookup_key) -> Bool | Error
map_find_index(vm, frame, map, lookup_key) -> Index | NotFound | Error
map_upsert(vm, frame, map, key, value) -> void | Error
```

`Set` must use the same normalization and equality machinery:

```text
set_find_index(vm, frame, set, element) -> Index | NotFound | Error
set_add(vm, frame, set, element) -> void | Error
```

Lookup key normalization occurs once per lookup operation, not once per existing entry.

---

# 3. Supported key types

## 3.1. Built-in scalar keys

The following built-in values are valid keys:

```text
Null
Bool
Symbol
Str
Int
Float
```

Examples:

```sputnik
{
  null: "null",
  true: "bool",
  :name: "symbol",
  "name": "string",
  1: "int",
  1.5: "float",
}
```

Numeric key equality follows Sputnik numeric equality. If Sputnik equality says `1 == 1.0`, then `Map` and `Set` treat them as equal keys/elements.

---

## 3.2. Float edge cases

`0.0` and `-0.0` compare according to Sputnik numeric equality. If Sputnik numeric equality treats them as equal, `Map` and `Set` must also treat them as equal.

```sputnik
m = {0.0: :zero}
m[-0.0]  # :zero, if 0.0 == -0.0 in Sputnik
```

`NaN` float values are rejected as `Map` keys and `Set` elements unless Sputnik explicitly defines `NaN == NaN` as true.

Recommended v1 rule:

```text
TypeError
NaN cannot be used as a Map key
```

For `Set`:

```text
TypeError
NaN cannot be used as a Set element
```

Rationale: a key that cannot equal itself cannot be reliably found after insertion.

---

## 3.3. Range keys

Ranges are valid keys.

Range keys compare structurally by effective range model:

```text
start
finish / open-ended marker
inclusive vs exclusive end
step
range kind / numeric endpoint behavior
```

Range key equality must not materialize the range.

Open-ended ranges are valid keys if their structure is equal.

```sputnik
m = {(1..): :open}

m[(1..)]     # :open
m[(1..:2)]   # KeyError
```

Float range validation remains governed by range construction rules. A float range without an explicit step is rejected before or during range construction, not by `Map` key validation.

Invalid:

```sputnik
{(1.0..2.0): :bad}
```

Required diagnostic remains:

```text
E_RANGE_FLOAT_STEP_REQUIRED
float ranges require an explicit step
```

---

## 3.4. Tuple keys

Tuples are valid keys.

Tuple keys compare element-by-element using the same key equality rules recursively.

```sputnik
m = {(1, "x"): :ok}

m[(1, "x")]    # :ok
m[(1.0, "x")]  # :ok, if 1 == 1.0
```

Nested arrays/lists inside tuple keys are normalized recursively to tuple snapshots.

---

## 3.5. Array/list keys

Arrays/lists are accepted as keys only through normalization to tuple snapshots.

```sputnik
m = {[1, 2]: :ok}

m[(1, 2)]  # :ok
m[[1, 2]]  # :ok
```

The original array identity is not part of the key.

---

## 3.6. Instance object keys

Instance object keys are valid only if they provide meaningful value equality through `==`.

The equality call must return `Bool`.

If `==` is missing, resolves only to default identity equality, or returns a non-`Bool`, key comparison raises `TypeError`.

Invalid equality result:

```sputnik
class BadEq:
  def ==(other):
    "yes"

m = {BadEq(): 1}
m[BadEq()]
```

Required error:

```text
TypeError
key equality method `==` must return Bool
```

---

# 4. Map literal syntax

## 4.1. Bare identifier shorthand is preserved

A bare identifier before `:` remains a symbol key shorthand.

```sputnik
{name: value}
```

means:

```sputnik
{:name: value}
```

This rule preserves existing symbol-key map behavior and conditional map entry syntax.

---

## 4.2. Explicit symbol keys

Explicit symbol keys remain valid:

```sputnik
{:name: value}
```

This is equivalent to:

```sputnik
{name: value}
```

except that the explicit symbol form is unambiguous at the source level.

---

## 4.3. Literal expression keys

The following literal keys are expression keys:

```sputnik
{1: value}
{1.5: value}
{"name": value}
{null: value}
{true: value}
{false: value}
{(1, 2): value}
{[1, 2]: value}
```

Important change:

```sputnik
{"name": 1}
```

has a `Str` key, not a symbol-compatible key.

Therefore:

```sputnik
m = {"name": 1}

m["name"]  # 1
m[:name]   # KeyError
m[?:name]  # null
```

---

## 4.4. Parenthesized expression keys

Any non-literal expression key must be parenthesized:

```sputnik
{(name): value}
{(user.id): value}
{(compute_key()): value}
{(if ok then a else b): value}
```

A bare identifier is never a variable key in map literal key position.

```sputnik
{name: value}    # Symbol key :name
{(name): value}  # value of variable/expression `name`
```

Rationale:

* preserves existing shorthand;
* makes expression keys explicit;
* avoids parser ambiguity with labels, conditional entries and future map-entry extensions.

---

## 4.5. Range keys require parentheses

Range expression keys must be parenthesized.

Valid:

```sputnik
{(1..5): value}
{(1...5): value}
{(1..5:2): value}
{(1..): value}
```

Invalid:

```sputnik
{1..5: value}
{1..5:2: value}
```

Required diagnostic:

```text
E_MAP_KEY_RANGE_PARENS_REQUIRED
range expression keys in map literals must be parenthesized
```

Rationale:

Range step syntax already uses `:`. Parenthesizing range keys keeps map entries visually and grammatically unambiguous.

---

## 4.6. Conditional map entries

Conditional map entries continue to apply to the whole entry, not only the value expression.

```sputnik
{
  name: user.name,
  "debug": true if debug?,
  (dynamic_key): value unless skip?,
}
```

If the condition is falsy, neither the key expression nor the value expression is evaluated for that entry.

This rule is especially important for dynamic expression keys with side effects.

---

# 5. Set literal behavior

`Set` construction uses the same key normalization and key equality as `Map`.

```sputnik
s = {[1, 2], (1, 2), 1, 1.0}

s.count()  # 2, if 1 == 1.0
```

Array/list elements are normalized to tuple snapshots.

Duplicate elements collapse while preserving the first stored normalized element.

Conditional set elements continue to control element presence:

```sputnik
{
  :read,
  :write if can_write?,
  [1, 2] if include_pair?,
}
```

If the condition is falsy, the element expression is not evaluated.

---

# 6. Map operations

All `Map` operations that observe, lookup, create or transform keys must use normalized arbitrary keys.

Required affected operations:

```sputnik
map[key]
map[?key]
map[key] = value
map.contains?(key)
map.include?(key)
map.keys()
map.values()
map.entries()
map.to_a()
map.each |k, v|:
  ...
map.map |k, v|:
  ...
map.select |k, v|:
  ...
map.reject |k, v|:
  ...
map.transform |k, v|:
  (new_key, new_value)
map.transform_values |v, k|:
  ...
map.merge(other)
map + other
map | other
pairs.to_map()
```

Strict lookup:

```sputnik
map[key]
```

raises `KeyError` when the normalized key is valid but absent.

Optional lookup:

```sputnik
map[?key]
```

returns `null` when the normalized key is valid but absent.

Optional lookup must not swallow key validation errors or equality protocol errors.

Example:

```sputnik
map[?bad_key]
```

still raises `TypeError` if `bad_key` is not a valid key.

---

# 7. Set operations

All `Set` operations that observe, lookup, create or transform elements must use the same normalization and equality rules as `Map` keys.

Required affected operations:

```sputnik
set.add(value)
set.delete(value)
set.include?(value)
set.contains?(value)
set.each |x|:
  ...
set.map |x|:
  ...
set.select |x|:
  ...
set.reject |x|:
  ...
set | other
set & other
set - other
set ^ other
items.to_set()
```

Array and Tuple membership outside `Set` remains governed by existing `value_equals` / collection equality behavior unless the operation explicitly constructs or operates through a `Set`.

---

# 8. Pattern matching and `deconstruct_keys`

Pattern matching remains symbol-key based.

Named-key map patterns observe only entries whose normalized stored key is `Symbol`.

```sputnik
m = {name: "Ada", "name": "string", 1: "one"}

case m
in {name: n}
  n  # "Ada"
end
```

Non-symbol keys do not satisfy named-key patterns.

`deconstruct_keys` remains symbol-key based. Non-symbol map keys are preserved in the source map and are treated as extra entries for full-map/rest behavior.

Rest behavior:

```sputnik
case {name: "Ada", "name": "str", 1: "one"}
in {name: n, **rest}
  rest
end
```

`rest` contains the unmatched non-symbol entries unless a more specific future pattern RFC changes rest semantics.

This patch does not introduce expression-key map patterns.

Invalid / not introduced:

```sputnik
case m
in {"name": x}
  ...
end
```

unless already valid under a separate pattern-matching rule outside this patch.

---

# 9. Bytecode

## 9.1. Existing `MakeMap`

Existing `MakeMap` remains valid for symbol-immediate maps and old bytecode/tests.

It constructs maps whose keys are `Symbol` values.

The existing bytecode format remains loadable.

---

## 9.2. New `MakeMapDyn`

Add bytecode opcode:

```text
MakeMapDyn = 0x0D
```

Operands:

```text
dst, count, (key_reg, value_reg)*
```

Example conceptual encoding:

```text
MakeMapDyn r0, 2, r1, r2, r3, r4
```

means:

```text
r0 = make_map_value([(r1, r2), (r3, r4)])
```

The VM normalizes keys, validates keys and applies duplicate overwrite semantics while constructing the map.

---

## 9.3. Emitter strategy

Recommended emitter strategy:

1. If all keys are static symbol keys, emit existing `MakeMap`.
2. If any key is dynamic or non-symbol, emit `MakeMapDyn`.

Examples:

```sputnik
{name: v, age: a}
```

may emit old `MakeMap`.

```sputnik
{"name": v}
```

must emit `MakeMapDyn`.

```sputnik
{(name): v}
```

must emit `MakeMapDyn`.

```sputnik
{:name: v}
```

may emit old `MakeMap` as an optimization.

---

## 9.4. Verifier requirements

The bytecode verifier must validate:

```text
count >= 0
operand_count == 2 * count + 2
all key registers are initialized before the opcode
all value registers are initialized before the opcode
source register references are in range
dst register is in range
```

If `dst` aliases a key or value source register, the VM must read all source operands before writing `dst`, or the verifier must reject such aliasing.

Malformed `MakeMapDyn` bytecode must fail verification deterministically.

---

## 9.5. Serializer, disassembler and quick analyses

The bytecode serializer, deserializer, disassembler, verifier, quick analyses and opcode registry must be updated for `MakeMapDyn`.

Disassembly should preserve the key/value register pair structure:

```text
MakeMapDyn r0, count=2, (r1 => r2), (r3 => r4)
```

or equivalent deterministic formatting.

---

# 10. Parser and HIR lowering

## 10.1. AST/HIR distinction

The parser should preserve source-faithful map key forms:

```text
BareIdentifierKey(name)
SymbolLiteralKey(:name)
StringLiteralKey("name")
LiteralExprKey(...)
ParenExprKey(...)
```

HIR lowering determines whether the map can use static symbol-key construction or dynamic key construction.

---

## 10.2. Recommended lowering

```sputnik
{name: value}
```

lowers to a symbol key:

```text
Symbol(:name), value
```

```sputnik
{:name: value}
```

lowers to the same symbol key.

```sputnik
{"name": value}
```

lowers to a string key expression.

```sputnik
{(name): value}
```

lowers to the expression value of `name`.

```sputnik
{[1, 2]: value}
```

lowers to an array expression key; runtime key normalization converts it to a tuple snapshot.

---

# 11. Diagnostics

## 11.1. Invalid object key

```text
TypeError
object used as Map key must define value equality with `==`
```

```text
TypeError

---

## 11.6. Unsupported expression key spelling

For arbitrary unparenthesized non-literal expression keys:

```text
E_MAP_KEY_EXPR_PARENS_REQUIRED
expression keys in map literals must be parenthesized
```

Example invalid form if the parser would otherwise accept it:

```sputnik
{user.id: value}
```

Required form:

```sputnik
{(user.id): value}
```

```

```sputnik

```

---

## 13.6. Tuple and Array normalization tests

assert(m[[1, 2]] == :tuple)
assert(m[(1.0, 2.0)] == :tuple)
```

assert(m[(1, 2)] == :ok)
assert_raises(KeyError):
  m[(9, 2)]
```

---

## 13.8. Custom object equality tests

Working custom object key:

```sputnik
class Point:
  def init(@x, @y):
    noop

  attr x
  attr y

  def ==(other):
    other.is_a?(Point) and @x == other.x and @y == other.y

m = {Point(1, 2): :p}

assert(m[Point(1, 2)] == :p)
```

Inherited equality:

```sputnik
class A:
  def ==(other):
    other.is_a?(A)

class B < A:
  noop

m = {B(): :b}
assert(m[B()] == :b)
```

Missing equality:

```sputnik
class NoEq:
  noop

assert_raises(TypeError):
  {NoEq(): 1}
```

Non-Bool equality result:

```sputnik
class BadEq:
  def ==(other):
    "yes"

m = {BadEq(): 1}

assert_raises(TypeError):
  m[BadEq()]
```

Asymmetric stored-key dispatch:

```sputnik
class A:
  def ==(other):
    true

class B:
  def ==(other):
    false

a = A()
b = B()

m = {a: :a}
assert(m[b] == :a)

m2 = {b: :b}
assert_raises(KeyError):
  m2[a]
```

---

## 13.9. Optional bracket tests

```sputnik
m = {[1, 2]: :ok}

assert(m[?(1, 2)] == :ok)
assert(m[?[1, 3]] == null)
```

Optional lookup does not hide invalid keys:

```sputnik
class NoEq:
  noop

m = {}

assert_raises(TypeError):
  m[?NoEq()]
```

---

## 13.10. Pattern matching regression tests

```sputnik
m = {name: "Ada", "name": "string", 1: "one"}

case m
in {name: n}
  assert(n == "Ada")
end
```

Rest includes non-symbol unmatched keys:

```sputnik
case {name: "Ada", "name": "str", 1: "one"}
in {name: n, **rest}
  assert(rest["name"] == "str")
  assert(rest[1] == "one")
end
```

`deconstruct_keys` remains symbol-key based.

## 13.11. Regression tests

* Existing symbol-key maps.
* Existing `Map` methods.
* Existing `Set` methods.
* Conditional map entries.
* Conditional set elements.
* Optional bracket access.
* Range syntax and range-step diagnostics.
* Map patterns and `deconstruct_keys`.
* Current dirty-worktree tests must be preserved and built on, not reverted.

# 14. Compatibility notes

## 14.1. Source compatibility

Existing symbol-key map literals remain valid:

```sputnik
{name: value}
```

continues to mean symbol key `:name`.

String-key maps change only if an implementation previously treated string literal keys as symbol-compatible. Under this patch:

```sputnik
{"name": value}
```

is always a real `Str` key.

---

## 14.2. Bytecode compatibility

Old bytecode using `MakeMap` remains valid.

New bytecode using expression keys must use `MakeMapDyn`.

---

## 14.3. Pattern compatibility

Existing map patterns remain symbol-key based.

This patch does not make string keys match symbol-name patterns.

# 15. Summary of normative decisions

1. `Map` entries store `key: Value` and `value: Value`.
2. `Map` and `Set` remain ordered-vector based in the reference implementation.
3. Built-in scalar keys include `Null`, `Bool`, `Symbol`, `Str`, `Int`, `Float`.
4. `NaN` keys/elements are rejected unless Sputnik explicitly defines self-equality for NaN.
5. Numeric key equality follows Sputnik numeric equality.
6. Duplicate `Map` insertion overwrites only the value and preserves the first stored key.
7. Duplicate `Set` insertion preserves the first stored element.
8. Range keys are structural and never materialized for equality.
9. Tuple keys compare recursively through key equality.
10. Array/list keys normalize to immutable tuple snapshots.
11. Cyclic composite keys/elements are rejected.
12. Instance object keys require meaningful non-default `==` equality.
13. Object key equality is stored-key dispatched.
14. `==` used for key equality must return `Bool`.
15. `{name: value}` remains symbol shorthand.
16. `{(name): value}` is an expression key.
17. `{"name": value}` is a `Str` key.
18. Range keys in map literals require parentheses.
19. `MakeMap` remains for symbol-immediate maps.
20. `MakeMapDyn = 0x0D` constructs dynamic-key maps.
21. Optional lookup suppresses absence only, not invalid-key or equality-protocol errors.
22. Pattern matching and `deconstruct_keys` remain symbol-key based.

# 16. Assumptions

* No implementation edits were made in this planning document.
* Existing uncommitted parser/HIR/emitter/runtime/tests changes must be preserved and built on, not reverted.
* No `<=>` protocol is implemented for key equality in this change.
* No hash table is introduced in this change.
* No expression-key map patterns are introduced in this change.
