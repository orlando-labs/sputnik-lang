// RuntimeReactor: a single epoll/kqueue-backed readiness loop for the VM's
// cooperative async machine. A dedicated reactor thread owns the kqueue (macOS)
// / epoll (Linux) instance and a self-pipe used to wake it for control changes
// (new registrations, cancellation kicks, fd close, shutdown).
//
// Layer A (this revision): `wait()` blocks the calling worker thread on a
// per-waiter condition variable until the fd is actionable, the deadline
// passes, the task's cancel flag is observed, or the fd is closed. This
// replaces the old per-fd `::poll()` busy-loop in io.cpp (10ms re-poll cadence)
// with an event-driven wait and prompt, cross-thread cancellation/close
// wakeups.
//
// Layer B (cooperative suspension) reuses the same loop: instead of blocking a
// worker, a strand will register interest and yield its coroutine; the reactor
// thread completes the registration and the scheduler resumes the coroutine on
// another worker. The registration model below (one reactor thread, control via
// self-pipe wake) is shaped for that follow-on -- only the waiter's "how do I
// resume" differs (condvar today, coroutine resume later).
